# ProtoShotXAI
This repository provides the training and algorithm demonstration for the paper
[ProtoShotXAI: Prototypical Few-Shot Architecture for Explainable AI.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.11597)

We are still in the process of updating this repository so please be patient and check back soon for additional instructions and pretrained models -- 10/26/2021

### Getting Strated
Install dependencies (I prefer a conda environment)
- `conda create -n ProtoShotXAI python=3.6`
- `conda activate ProtoShotXAI`
- `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- `python -m ipykernel install --user --name ProtoShotXAI`
- `python setup.py develop` (or `python setup.py install` if you don't want to do development)
